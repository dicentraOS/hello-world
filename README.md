# hello-world
An introductory repository on dicentraOS.

Context: So, I'm currently trying to build a new and efficient way to generate content for a YouTube channel of mine in the works,
and I figured after seeing so many videos on the power of unrestricted smartphones and their graphics, I could use AI to generate
some cool animations which can be used later for all sorts of things. Anyways, here's what I have so far:

Device: Google Pixel 6A:
Booting Into Fastboot Mode: Android Bluejay & LineageOS
Booting Into Recovery Mode: LineageOS
ROM: Android 12 GSI (Fastest and Broken Down Version)

Why Are We Doing This? I want to build a prototype where custom apps are used on a minimal GSI (Generic System Image) via
a compatible Android device in order to generate these sufficient AI-driven graphics. Since other ROMs like postmarketOS are
not exactly suitable in alignment with GPU acceleration tasks, this is the optimal way to build what will later become a more
sufficient version of dicentraOS.

Updates: A lot of the updates via this GitHub page will be apps I'll be developing to customize dicentraOS, so keep an eye
out for anything I may develop. If you want to assist me in developing these custom apps, you can reach me via email
tolga.acan@proton.me.
